A comprehensive **YM2612/OPN2 patch editor** for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive sound chip. Designed for musicians, sound designers, and chiptune enthusiasts who want to create and experiment with FM synthesis patches.

Access via **View ▸ Patch Lab**.
Changes apply directly to your active patch with full undo support.

- **Randomize** – Generates a new patch each time.
- **Blend merge** – Mixes two patches from your patches by randomly choosing parameters from Patch A and Patch B. You can pick both sources via combo boxes and reuse seeds.
- **Morph blend** – Interpolates between two patches using a 0–1 blend slider with smooth parameter transitions.
- **Mutate** – Applies subtle or extreme perturbations to the current patch. Adjust variation depth, probability, and algorithm-lock toggles to taste, or repeat with a fixed seed for reproducible tweaks.
